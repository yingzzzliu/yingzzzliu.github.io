## Learning Log

Additionally, I have included a [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19reI4ZggJKOIdsoU3H6Nt2q8tzXbo1aKiM4u9akXQWo/edit?usp=sharing) to show my application of concepts taught during class in my final project. It also includes some extra learning I did beyond this course and how it has been helpful to my final project set up :) .
