    "text": "Hi! I am Liu Yingzhe, a Year 3 Psychology and Communications and New Media student. I took psychology because I thought the way why humans do what we do was really interesting and I wanted to learn more about it (although I am absolutely crushed in my classes right now)…I took CNM as a second major because I think communication is really essential in our life and good communication skills can have a significant impact on whatever we set out too do.\nI took this module, NM2207 as I was interested in coding and wanted to pick up a new skill! I have previous experience in Wix and figured it would be a fun challenge if I could code a website and customise it to my preferences.\n\nIn my project, I am interested to explore how can the Happiness Index of countries predict their economic/state if there are any relationships between the index value and the economic/social state of the country."

On March 20th, the World Happiness 2017 report, unveiling happiness rankings for 155 countries, was presented at the United Nations during an event commemorating the International Day of Happiness. Over time, the report has garnered widespread acknowledgment, influencing governments, organizations, and civil society in utilizing happiness indicators to shape their policy decisions. Esteemed experts spanning various disciplines such as economics, psychology, survey analysis, national statistics, health, and public policy underline the effective application of well-being measurements in evaluating the progress of nations."
