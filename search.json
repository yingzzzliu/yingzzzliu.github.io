    "text": "Hi! I am Liu Yingzhe, a Year 3 Psychology and Communications and New Media student. I took psychology because I thought the way why humans do what we do was really interesting and I wanted to learn more about it (although I am absolutely crushed in my classes right now)…I took CNM as a second major because I think communication is really essential in our life and good communication skills can have a significant impact on whatever we set out too do.\nI took this module, NM2207 as I was interested in coding and wanted to pick up a new skill! I have previous experience in Wix and figured it would be a fun challenge if I could code a website and customise it to my preferences.\n\nIn my project, I am interested to explore how can the Happiness Index of countries predict their economic/state if there are any relationships between the index value and the economic/social state of the country."
